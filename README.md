# Plotly_BellyButton_Biodiversity

## Purpose

* **Create basic plots with Plotly, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.**
* **Use D3.json() to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.**
* **Parse data in JSON format.**
* **Use functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.**
* **Use JavaScript's Math library to manipulate numbers.**
* **Use event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization.**
* **How to use interactivity to enhance your visualizations.**
* **Deploy an interactive chart to GitHub Pages.**

## Overview

Rosa, a biological researcher is looking to synthecizse protein which tastes like beef from bacterial culture found in a human's belly button. For this, data has been collected from volunteers from various age group and ethnicity. Sample data includes type of bacteria found, in how much quantity each type of bacteria is present, bacteria label and the frequency of washing the sample area has been collected. 

Interactive charts has been formed to show results of data. Below is a summary of chart information:

1. **Bar Chart showing the top 10 bacteria cultures found in a volunteer's sample area based on sample data collected.**

2. **Guage Chart showing the frequency of sample area being washed. Volunteers with lower washing frequency provided higher concentration of bacteria culture in their sample**

3. **Bubble Chart showing the bacteria cultures collected from volunteers. Bigger bubble represents higher number of the same bacteria in the sample**
